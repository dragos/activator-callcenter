    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p><h3>Building parts</h3></p>

    <p>
    The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/akka/callcenter" class="shortcut">scala</a> directory contains the Scala
    source code. In detail the following files are contained within this directory referring to the main building parts of the application:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/akka/callcenter/Main.scala" class="shortcut">Main.scala</a>: Sets up the environment and triggers some service requests from customers</li>
      <li><a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/akka/callcenter/CallCenter.scala" class="shortcut">CallCenter.scala</a>: Describes the callcenter itself</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    In the following sections this tutorial describes these different building parts of the 
    callcenter from a business point of view as well as from a technical point of view.

    <h2>Main</h2>
    <p>
        The Main-object first of all sets up the call center environment during initialization 
<pre>
    <code>
val system = ActorSystem("CallCenterSimulation")
val company = system.actorOf(Props(Company()), "Company")
val customer = system.actorOf(Props((Customer())), "Customer")
val callCenter = system.actorOf(Props(CallCenter(company)), "CallCenter")
    </code>
</pre>            
      In the main-method it triggers an arbitrarly number of
        customer service requests of the form
<pre>
    <code>
val (callNumber, skill) = Await.result((customer ? Customer.GetCallNumber).mapTo[(CallNumber, Skill)], 5.seconds)

system.scheduler.scheduleOnce(200.millis) {
  callCenter ! CallCenter.CustomerCall(callNumber,
    skill)
}
    </code>
</pre>        
</p>
    
<p>
    <h3>Typesafe Console</h3>
    The workload of system can be visualized by the Typesafe Console.

    <h2>Call Center</h2>
    <p><h3>Business Context</h3></p>
    <p>Once an environment designed to process telephone calls, call centers have evolved to become 
    customer contact centers, processing all types of media transactions. The contact center is now seen as 
    the core of a business due to its critical role in maximizing customer retention by enabling companies 
    to deliver a definitive customer experience. Its integral parts consist of:
    <ul>
        <li>Representatives who handle customer transactions (also called agents)</li>
        <li>Management personnel</li>
        <li>Technology to handle customer transactions, including the routing, treatment, and fulfilment of the transaction.
        A contact center may be found within a department in a company or it may be the sole business unit that comprises
        the company.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    A call center has a unique reference to a company which manages departments. For each department there exist
    an agent supervisor which is responsible for a set of agents and the routing of requests to the appropriate agents.
    </p>
    <p>
    The current template only focuses on the request handling functionality of a call center. This means that 
    the call center services an arbitrary set of telephone numbers which each number belonging to a department inside
    the company. When a call comes in from a customer the call center analyzes the call number to determine the 
    responsible department. The department specific agent supervisor is then informed to route the request to the 
    appropriate agent depending on the agent skills and the work status of the agent.
    </p>
   <p><h3>Technical Details</h3></p>
   <h4><b>General</b></h4>
   <p>The <code>CallCenter</code> is the root of an actor hierarchy and describes the main starting point for routing 
   incoming calls from customers. To handle those requests the call center sets up agent supervisors 
   (one for each department) and as a <code>RoutingProvider</code> initializes the Routing, which determines the 
   correct supervisor to route the call to.</p>
   <h4><b>Scala Component Structure</b></h4>
   <p>The <code>CallCenter</code> structure is a typical example for how Scala-classes are designed throughout this template.
   The following Scala design principles are used:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Self-type annotation</b>: One can use self-type annotations to specify additional types that 
        the self object <code>this</code> can take within the class. In this case there a two traits 
        <code>AgentSupervisorProvider</code> and <code>RoutingProvider</code> used for the annotation.
        Its almost like saying <code>class CallCenter extends AgentSupervisorProvider with RoutingProvider</code> but 
        saying it implicitly. The compile time dependency is not created at this time. The self-type annotation 
        indicates a promise that the two Provider-classes will be mixed in during any concrete instantiation of the object.
        </li>
        <li><b>Mixin-Composition</b>: 
         In order to make the class flexible enough to for example use it in test as well as in production mode
         mixin-composition is used.
         <p>
         Production:
         <pre>
             <code>
object CallCenter {

      ...
    
      def apply(company: ActorRef) = {
        new CallCenter(company) with ProdAgentSupervisorProvider with ProdRoutingProvider
      }
}
              </code>
          </pre>
          Test:
          <pre>
             <code>
object CallCenter {

      ...
    
      def apply(company: ActorRef) = {
        new CallCenter(company) with TestAgentSupervisorProvider with TestRoutingProvider
      }
}

...
val company = system.actorOf(Props(Company()), "Company")
val callCenter = system.actorOf(Props(CallCenter(company)), "CallCenter")
              </code>
          </pre>
          </p>
        </li>
    </ul> 
   </p>
   <h4><b>Akka Asynchronous Call Pattern</b></h4>
   <p>The <code>DefaultRouting</code>-class uses the Asynchronous Call Pattern, 
   described in Jamie Allen's Book "Effective Akka" to determine the Agent Supervisor for calculating
   a routing strategy. 
   For each agent supervisor department a separate anonymous actor is used to determine whether
   the working time of the department is within the range of the current time. 
   If all departments are checked the <code>businessHourCheckComplete</code>-method
   finishes with the inforation of the still working departments. 
   The <code>RouteAccordingToBusinessHours</code>-message checks whether the computed department
   according the call number is still open for business and sends the referenced agent supervisor
   the message to route the call to the appropriate agent.
   <pre>
       <code>
class DefaultRouting(callCenter: ActorRef, agentSuperVisors: Map[String, ActorRef], deptNames: Seq[String]) extends Routing with Actor with ActorLogging {
  import Routing._
  import Company.IsDuringBusinessHours
  import DepartmentBase.generalDept

  def receive: Receive = {
    case Route(callNbr: CallNumber, forSkill: Skill) =>
      val originalSender = self
      // Calculate the responsible department

      val department = callNbr.selectDepartment(deptNames)

      val agentSupervisorInfo = (department, agentSuperVisors(department))

      agentSupervisorInfo match {
        //case (_, EscalationSupervisor) => callCenter ! play music for correct service numbers
        case (_, _) =>

          val callDuringBusinessHoursActor = context.actorOf(Props(new Actor with ActorLogging {

            var duringBusinessHours: Map[String, Boolean] = Map()

            def receive = {
              case DepartmentBase.DuringBusinessHours(deptName, isDuringBusiness) =>
                duringBusinessHours += (deptName -> isDuringBusiness)
                businessHourCheckComplete
              case BusinessHourCheckTimeout =>
                sendResponseAndShutdown(BusinessHourCheckTimeout)
            }

            def businessHourCheckComplete() = {
              val duringBusinessHourKeys = duringBusinessHours.keys.toList
              val complete = (agentSuperVisors.keys.size == duringBusinessHourKeys.size) &&
                (true /: agentSuperVisors.keys) { (res, deptName) =>
                  {
                    if (duringBusinessHourKeys.contains(deptName))
                      res && true
                    else
                      res && false
                  }
                }
              if (complete) {
                timeoutMessager.cancel
                sendResponseAndShutdown(RouteAccordingToBusinessHours(agentSuperVisors, agentSupervisorInfo,
                  duringBusinessHours, forSkill))
              }
            }

            def sendResponseAndShutdown(response: Any) = {
              originalSender ! response
              log.debug("Stopping context capturing actor for businessHourCheck")
              context.stop(self)
            }

            import context.dispatcher
            val timeoutMessager = context.system.scheduler.scheduleOnce(250 milliseconds) {
              self ! BusinessHourCheckTimeout
            }
          }))

          val date = new Date()

          agentSuperVisors.keys foreach {
            deptName => callCenter.tell(Company.IsDuringBusinessHours(deptName, date), callDuringBusinessHoursActor)
          }

      }

    case RouteAccordingToBusinessHours(agentSuperVisors: Map[String, ActorRef],
      agentSupervisor: (String, ActorRef), duringBusinessHours: Map[String, Boolean],
      forSkill: Skill) =>
      duringBusinessHours(agentSupervisor._1) match {

        case true => agentSupervisor._2 ! RoutingStrategyProvider.Route(forSkill)
        case false => agentSuperVisors.filter(supervisor => duringBusinessHours(supervisor._1)).headOption.map(_._2).getOrElse(agentSuperVisors(generalDept)) ! RoutingStrategyProvider.Route(forSkill)
      }
  }

}
       </code>
   </pre>
   </p>
   <h4><b>Akka Actor Hierarchy</b></h4>
   <p>A <code>CallCenter</code>-object is designed as the root in the actor-hierarchy. For the children of
       <code>AgentSupervisor</code>'s it is using its own restart strategy instead of the normal strategy to 
       restart every single child. 
       it uses the strategy to stop every node in the case of exception. This can easily be changed to the default 
       if the following code-block is removed:
       <pre>
           <code>
override val supervisorStrategy = OneForOneStrategy() {
    case _: ActorInitializationException => Stop
    case _: ActorKilledException => Restart
    case _: Exception => Resume
    case _ => Resume
}              
           </code>
       </pre>
   </p>
   <h4><b>Messages</b></h4>
   <p>A <code>CallCenter</code> has the following messages:
       <ul>
           <li><code>Company.GiveSkillsForDepartment(deptName)</code>: 
           An <code>AgentSupervisor</code> sends this message in order to build the agent skill sets. The
           message is forwarded to the company.
           </li>
           <li><code>Company.IsDuringBusinessHours(deptName, date)</code>
           The <code>DefaultRouting</code> object sends this message in order to determine whether
           the call is during the business hours of the department. The
           message is forwarded to the company.
           </li>
           <li><code>CustomerCall(callNbr: CallNumber, forSkill: Skill)</code>: 
           A customer call message is sent by the <code>Main</code>-class and defines the starting
           point of the process.
           </li>
       </ul>
   </p>
</div>

    <h2>Agent</h2>
    <p><h3>Business Context</h3></p>
    <p>An agent offers services (mostly "call services") for private or company customers. One distinguishes between 
    inbound or passive services and outbound or active services. Whereas inbound means that the agent is reacting
    to a call, for outbound the agent actively calls by himself and offers his services. 
    <br/>The current activator template only handles inbound calls.<br/>
    <p>According the business she works in every agent has preferred subjects called skills. 
    A skill is combined with a skill priority to make routing of incoming calls to agents possible. 
    </p>
   <p><h3>Technical Details</h3></p>
   <h4><b>General</b></h4>
   <p>A callcenter agent is implemented as an Akka Actor with simple state semantics. The state management is mapped 
   by the Akka <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/actors.html#become-unbecome">become/unbecome</a>
   feature. That means that by default an agent's <code>receive</code>-method maps to one of the 
   methods <code>handleSpecificTask</code> or <code>handleCall</code>. If routing sends the handleCall-message 
   a one-time scheduled job is started to send <code>takeCall</code> during a scheduled time in the future which simulates 
   the amount of time the agent works on the call. 
   At the same time the <code>receive</code>-method is thread-safely replaced inside the single-threaded actor by 
   the new behaviour which triggers the state change. 
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <h4><b>Messages</b></h4>
   <p>An <code>Agent</code>-object has the following messages it can react to:
       <ul>
           <li><code>TakeCall(forSkill: Skill, skillPriorities: List[SkillPriority])</code>: 
           This method is responsible for accepting a call for the questioned skill <code>forSkill</code> and 
           the skill priorities <code>skillPriorities</code> by a <code>RoutingStrategyProvider</code> The skill priorities are used by the asked agent 
           to give the asking skill based routing strategy provider feedback to recalculate a new agent if she is currently 
           busy. In this case the <code>CallNotHandled</code> message is send to the calling routing strategy provider.   
           </li>
           <li><code>HandleCall(forSkill: Skill, resultReceiver: ActorRef)</code>: 
           This method is responsible for handling a call for the questioned skill <code>forSkill</code> and 
           the receiver <code>resultReceiver</code> (the <code>RoutingStrategyProvider</code>). 
           The result receiver gets informed by sending it the message <code>CallHandled</code>. 
           </li>
       </ul>
   </p>
   <h4><b>Telephone answer agent</b></h4>
   <p>In case the routing strategy provider may not find an agent to whom a call might be routed 
   the call is routed to a <code>TelephoneAnswerAgent</code>.   
   </p>
   <h4><b>Configuration</b></h4>
   <p>Agents are configurable. A typical agent configuration looks like:
        <pre><code>
com {
    akka {
          agents { 
      		SERVICE =
	      		[[ServiceAgent1, {General = 1, General1 = 3}],
	      		 [ServiceAgent2, {General = 3, General1 = 1}],
	      		 [ServiceAgent3, {General = 2, General1 = 2}],
	      		 [ServiceAgent4, {General = 3, General1 = 3}],
	      		 [ServiceAgent5, {General = 2, General1 = 2}]]
      	}
     }
}
}</code></pre>
    An agent is configured per department (in this example "Service") with department specific skills and skill priorities. 
   </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Agent Supervisor</h2>
    <p><h3>Business Context</h3></p>
    <p>
    An Agent Supervisor is responsible for the administration of agents. This includes the following tasks:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Provision of agents for handling customer service requests
        </li>
        <li>
            For each agent provision of a skill set, which defines the agent skills and skill priorities. 
            A skill set is used by a routing strategy to choose an agent for service request
        </li>
        <li>
            Definition of a routing strategy, which allows routing of an incoming service request to an agent. 
        </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p><h3>Technical Details</h3></p>
   <h4><b>General</b></h4>
   <p>An <code>AgentSupervisor</code> is designed as an Akka child node in the CallCenter-Actor hierarchy and as such
   supervised by the <code>CallCenter</code>-supervisor. The <code>AgentSupervisor</code> uses a Scala component 
   architecture to offer functionalities to provide agents, skill sets and routing strategies. 
   An <code>AgentSupervisor</code> uses simple state semantics to switch between agent-routing and agent-broadcasting
   modes.
   </p>
   <h4><b>Scala Component Structure</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Self-type annotation</b>: The traits 
        <code>RoutingStrategyProvider</code>, <code>SkillSetProvider</code> and <code>AgentProvider</code> 
        are used for the annotation.
        </li>
        <li><b>Mixin-Composition</b>: 
         In order to make the class flexible enough to for example use it in test as well as in production mode
         mixin-composition is used. For concreate instantiation of an object the traits 
         <code>SkillBasedBusyAskRoutingStrategyProvider</code>, <code>ConfigSkillSetProvider</code> and
         <code>AgentProvider</code> are used. The <code>SkillBasedBusyAskRoutingStrategyProvider</code> uses a
         Akka-future based algorithm to route calls on the base of agent skills to the agents. 
         The <code>ConfigSkillSetProvider</code> sets up agent skills with the help of the type configuration. 
         <p>
         <pre>
             <code>
object AgentSupervisor {

  ...
  def apply(callCenter: ActorRef, department: ActorRef) = new AgentSupervisor(callCenter, department) 
                        with SkillBasedBusyAskRoutingStrategyProvider with ConfigSkillSetProvider with AgentProvider
}
              </code>
          </pre>
          </p>
        </li>
    </ul> 
   </p>
   <h4><b>Akka Actor Hierarchy</b></h4>
   <p>
       <p>An <code>AgentSupervisor</code>-object sets up a child actor to supervise the children of 
       <code>Agent</code>-objects and another child actor <code>TelephoneAnswerAgent</code>
       which handles unrouted customer requests. 
       For the children it is using its own <code>OneForOneStrategy</code> 
       <pre>
           <code>
override val supervisorStrategy = OneForOneStrategy() {
    case _: ActorKilledException => Restart
    case _: ActorInitializationException => Escalate
    case _ => Resume
}               
           </code>
       </pre>
       The child actor for the <code>Agent</code>-objects is an anonymous actor which supervises the 
       <code>Agent</code>-nodes with its own supervisor-strategy.
       <pre>
           <code>
override val supervisorStrategy = OneForOneStrategy() {
        case _: ActorKilledException => Restart
        case _: ActorInitializationException => Stop
        case _ => Resume
}               
           </code>
       </pre>
       With this strategy an <code>agent</code>-node is fault tolerant in the sense that it only stops if 
       something went wrong during initialization.
   </p>
   </p>
   <h4><b>Messages</b></h4>
   <p>An <code>AgentSupervisor</code>-object has the following messages it can react to:
       <ul>
           <li><code>SkillsForDepartment(skills)</code>: 
           This message is used by the <code>AgentSupervisor</code> itself during the initialization phase
           to set up the skill set of the department the <code>AgentSupervisor</code> belongs to.
           </li>
           <li><code>GetAgentBroadcaster</code>: 
           Gets send if some object is interested in broadcasting a message to all agents of the 
           <code>AgentSupervisor</code>. Returns a new <code>BroadcastRouter</code> in front of the agents
           if the supervisor is in state <code>noRouter</code>. If the supervisor is in state 
           <code>withRouter</code> the already existing <code>BroadcastRouter</code> captured in the context
           is returned.
           </li>
           <li><code>Children(_, destinedFor)</code>:
           If in state <code>withRouter</code> the children are requested the <code>BroadcastRouter</code>
           is returned.
           </li>
       </ul>
   </p>
   <h4><b>Agent broadcasting</b></h4>
   <p>The anynonymous child actor, which serves as a supervisor for the childs is also used to
   send back those childs when requested to support the work of a <code>BroadcastRouter</code>.
   <pre>
       <code>
def noRouter: Receive = {
    case GetAgentBroadcaster =>
      import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

      val destinedFor = sender
      val actor = context.actorFor("AgentSupervisor")
      (actor ? GetChildren).mapTo[Seq[ActorRef]].map {
        agents =>
          (Props().withRouter(BroadcastRouter(agents)),
            destinedFor)
      } pipeTo self
    case (props: Props, destinedFor: ActorRef) =>
      log.info(s"AgentSupervisor received (${props.toString()},${destinedFor.toString()}) (transforming to withRouter)")
      val router = context.actorOf(props, "Agents")
      destinedFor ! AgentBroadcaster(router)
      context.become(withRouter(router) orElse route)
       </code>
}
   </pre>
   The creation of the <code>BroadcastRouter</code> is initiated by transformation of the future result
   of the <code>GetChildren</code>-messsage via the <code>pipeTo</code>-method. The transformation result
   is send to <code>self</code> with the request-sender as a parameter.
